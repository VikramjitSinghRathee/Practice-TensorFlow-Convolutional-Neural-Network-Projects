## MNIST_tensorflow_CovNet.ipynb
MNIST digit image dataset (images with single digit from 0-9), where the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on labeled MNIST dataset and then the trained model can classify the digit from the testing set digit images. 

## dogs_vs_cats_Tensorflow_TFlearn.ipynb
Dogs and cats image dataset, where the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on labeled individual cat and dog image dataset and then the trained model can classify dog and cat images in the testing dataset. I utilized TensorFlow Deep Learning Library (TFLearn) for this project.
